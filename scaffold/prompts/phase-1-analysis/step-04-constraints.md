# Phase 1 - Step 4: Constraints & Risks

## Agent
Continue as **Analyst (Mary)**.

## Goal
Identify all project constraints and perform risk assessment.

## Instructions

### Constraints
1. Document all constraints in categories:
   - **Technical:** Platform, language, framework, infrastructure limitations
   - **Business:** Budget, timeline, team size, compliance
   - **User:** Accessibility needs, device support, offline requirements
   - **Integration:** External systems, APIs, data sources
2. For each constraint, note:
   - Source (who/what imposed it)
   - Impact (what it limits)
   - Flexibility (hard vs. soft constraint)

### Risks
3. Identify risks across categories:
   - Technical risks (complexity, unknowns, dependencies)
   - Business risks (market, competition, timeline)
   - Execution risks (team, skills, tools)
4. For each risk:
   - Likelihood (High/Medium/Low)
   - Impact (High/Medium/Low)
   - Mitigation strategy
5. Write to `bmalph/artifacts/analysis/constraints.md` and `bmalph/artifacts/analysis/risks.md`

## Scale Adaptation
- **Level 0-1:** Top 3-5 constraints and risks only
- **Level 2:** Standard assessment (5-10 each)
- **Level 3-4:** Comprehensive with risk matrix, mitigation plans

## Output
- `bmalph/artifacts/analysis/constraints.md`
- `bmalph/artifacts/analysis/risks.md`

## Completion Signal
When constraints and risks are documented, output:
```
STEP_COMPLETE
```
