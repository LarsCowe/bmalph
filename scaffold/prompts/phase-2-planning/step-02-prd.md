# Phase 2 - Step 2: Product Requirements Document

## Agent
Continue as **Product Manager (John)**.

## Goal
Create the Product Requirements Document from analysis artifacts.

## Instructions

1. Create `bmalph/artifacts/planning/prd.md` with these sections:

### PRD Structure
```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## 1. Executive Summary
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution (1-2 sentences)
- Target audience
- Key value proposition

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics
- Business goals
- User goals
- Measurable success criteria (quantified)

## 3. User Personas
- Primary persona(s) with needs, pain points, goals
- Secondary persona(s) if applicable

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Grouped by feature area
- Each with ID, description, priority, acceptance criteria

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance targets
- Security requirements
- Accessibility standards
- Scalability needs

## 6. Scope & Boundaries
- In scope (explicit)
- Out of scope (explicit)
- Assumptions
- Dependencies

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- Key risks from analysis phase
- Mitigation strategies
```

2. Ensure every requirement from Phase 1 is represented
3. Add acceptance criteria to each functional requirement
4. Quantify success metrics where possible

## Scale Adaptation
- **Level 0-1:** Lean PRD (1-2 pages), focus on core requirements
- **Level 2:** Standard PRD with all sections
- **Level 3-4:** Comprehensive PRD with detailed personas, full requirement tracing

## Output
Write PRD to `bmalph/artifacts/planning/prd.md`

## Completion Signal
When PRD is complete, output:
```
STEP_COMPLETE
```
